I code on occasion, believe it or not. My latest deal is I'm making as many useless Julia programs as humanly possible. I also have some non-coding things that I update on occasion, for example my kungfu skills

I love jokes. Also Popcorn. I work at Atomwise, follow me on twitter @jamesthesnake. Love making art!
